# Polarization Plot Generator

## Overview
This project provides an interactive website where users can generate polarization plots within given schematics. The platform allows users to explore and visualize different polarization states by modifying the configurations of the experimental setup.

## Features
- **Interactive Polarization Plots**: Users can generate and visualize polarization plots dynamically.
- **Configurable Experimental Setup**: Modify the components in the setup to explore different configurations.
- **Educational Content**: Learn about the experimental setup and the principles behind polarization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for easy interaction and customization.

## Installation
